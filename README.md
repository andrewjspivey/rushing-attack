A game in which the user is a running back attempting to get past the defenders and into the endzone

The starting screen will include a how to play button that when clicked will detail how to control their character with the keys as well as the breakdown of score and rounds and goals of user. The screen will also include a start button to begin the first round of the game. Once start button is clicked, the screen will go to the field view where the game begins with the user player and defenders images on the field,

The user controls one football player on a football field from a birds eye view, the only player on offense and has the ball. The user's player will be a different color than all of the defenders and will start close to their own enzone with the ball. The user's goal is to get the player with the ball to the opposite endzone without being tackled by one of the several defenders moving towards/ chasing him and make a touchdown. The user's character and the defenders will be able to move up(forward), down(backward), right or left using the arrow keys. The goal is to score a touchdown and move to the next round. Every touchdown will raise the score +7. There will be a scoreboard The user's goal is to get through four rounds scoring four touchdowns.

How it works The menu screen and the football field will be designed with HTML and CSS, using some DOM to have the how to play button display the instructions and the start button begin the first round. I will create classes for userPlayer and cpuPlayers with their functions to move. I will use Math.random to make cpu's move in semi random directions but toward the user. There will need to be functions for the program to know when user is tackled by cpu and to end the game and display a game over message. There will be a function to update the score. There will be a function to start a new round. A function to know when the user has scored a touchdown and bring up an alert that the user scored.
